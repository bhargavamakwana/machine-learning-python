# Machine learning repository

This repository contains functions and files related to machine learning with sample datasets for some, so that one can try and check for themselves.
In Addition, some of these fucntions although available largely on a tons of libraries are implemented by me for learning and fun :)
Feel free to create issues if any. let's make the best use of github!


The repository will contain functions and files for logistic regression, K-means and other Machine learning algorithms.
