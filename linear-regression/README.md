## Linear Regression on python


Run the command below to run a sample linear regression code on a dataset. Feel free to checkout the code on different datasets.

``
python3 linear_reg.py
``

In future, the code will be more robust, in the sense that it will allow a bunch of arguments to be set, and the implementation
will be more modular.
